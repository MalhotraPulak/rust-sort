## Sorting in Rust
Sorting a 32 bit unsigned integer vector by using:
- Radix Sort
- Quick Sort
- Merge Sort
- Bubble Sort
- Inbuilt Sort (Probably Tim Sort)

This program takes a vector length as input and generates an array of random numbers of that size.
Then it sorts this vector with each of the sorting algorithms and reports the time.

### How to run?
```bash
cargo run --release <length of vector to sort>
```

### A sample run with array length 50000
